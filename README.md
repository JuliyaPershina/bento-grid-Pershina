![Design preview for the Bento grid coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my checking out of front-end coding challenge from
[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) 

**To do this challenge, I need a good understanding of HTML and CSS.**

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this bento grid and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

### Expected behaviour

The two components in the left column on desktop are placed at the bottom on mobile. This is a good opportunity to practice your CSS Grid placement skills.

## Where to find everything

My task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

I use the local font files.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information about color palette and fonts.
